So, something interesting I've noticed 

I recently finished watching _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, and as anyone who's watched _Eva_ will know, the OP, "A Cruel Angel's Thesis", is a bop. While looking at various covers of this song (by [military bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXjIy0XQGi4), [pianos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYe-2Glruu4), and [bike horns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0&t=73s)), I stumbled upon this Cantonese cover. Truth be told, I thought this was official version at first, but a bit of digging (thank you, Google Translate) revealed that it's actually a fandub written by one "野火大鴻".

Interestingly, the lyrics aren't actually a direct translation of the original Japanese. Instead, this lyricist's taken it upon himself to write a _completely new OP_. But this isn't anything particularly new-- songwriters took the same liberties with a [Cantonese version of Les Misérables' "Do You Hear the People Sing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhQIOfDQdCo) that still manages to fit the themes of the original song very well. The same is true for this cover. Although the lyrics are completely different from the original Japanese version, the lyrics of the Cantonese cover arguably do a better job of acting as an OP, with the religious imagery seen in the show reflected in this cover in a way I don't think the original lyrics manage to do. I like these lyrics a lot! Below, I've provided my own English translation of this Cantonese cover of a Japanese song (yay  multiculturalism!):

		<h3> Cantonese </h3>
		讓聖經裏的迷途天使又傳道 <br>
		在這伊甸園你我又再碰到 <br>
		<br>
		使徒們,到世間浮沉 <br>
		歷史的真相有太多的神 <br>
		無論要你落淚,或要他的鮮血 <br>
		都不可見到神靈步近 <br>
		<br>
		阿門,我快將沉淪 <br>
		被貶的天使的向世間走近 <br>
		尋覓到我欲望,或有一點悲憤 <br>
		傷心怨恨從未發問 <br>
		<br>
		再抱撼再厭倦一生也未如願 <br>
		我也是經過路人 <br>
		你背後有對翼光圈裡又會否 <br>
		用真心拯救我心 <br>
    <br>
		<br>
		舊約中有位迷途天使在傳道 <br>
		暴走激鬥墮落時候會變化 <br>
		幻想全部頹然倒塌未留下 <br>
		但我想知道世界是有錯嗎 <br>
		用愛心與她靈魂交錯地存在 <br>
		倦透的都市有你便有火花 <br>
		<br>
		愛人,有太多傳聞 <br>
		歷史中毀去了幾多戀人 <br>
		然後我會落淚,與她驚天激吻 <br>
		都仿佛見到情如地陷 <br>
		<br>
		阿門,我已經沉淪 <br>
		被貶的天使向世間追問 <br>
		懷著救世欲望 <br>
    帶走相親相襯 <br>
		新的教義全部放任 <br>
    <br>
		再抱撼再厭倦一生也未如願 <br>
		我也是經過路人 <br>
		你背後有對翼光圈裡又會否 <br>
		用真心拯救我心 <br>
    <br>
		<br>
		在聖經裏的迷途天使又傳道 <br>
		但世間欺詐墜落全沒有變化 <br>
		諾亞拯救的人群早已沒留下 <br>
		讓這伊甸園戰鬥後變細沙 <br>
		用愛心妄想靈魂天使會存在 <br>
		倦透的都市有你便有火花 <br>
		<br>
		冷眼望再跌盪天邊也漸留下 <br>
		最美麗一片落霞 <br>
		對抗着憤慂着心中有夢我卻 <br>
		摘不走伊甸園野花 <br>
		<br>
    <br>
		舊約中有位迷途天使在傳道 <br>
		暴走激鬥墮落時候會變化 <br>
		幻想全部頹然倒塌未留下 <br>
		但我想知道世界是有錯嗎 <br>
		用愛心與她靈魂交錯地存在 <br>
		倦透的都市有你便有火花	<br>

      <h3> English </h3>
      Let the fallen angels of the Bible preach; <br>
      You and I meet in the Garden of Eden again. <br>
      <br>
      Apostles, drifting in the word--<br>
      The truth behind history involves too many gods.<br>
      They want your tears and they want your blood,<br>
      Yet are never seen drawing near to anyone.<br>  
      <br>
      Amen! I'm sinking back into sin, <br>
      The fallen angels draw near to Earth. <br>
      They found my deepest desires-- but perhaps also <br>
      The anger, sorrow, and hate I've never voiced. <br>
      <br>
      More regret, more fatigue, <br>
      another life with unfulfilled dreams, <br>
      I'm just another passerby on the street. <br>
      You with the halo and the wings on your back, <br>
      Will you use your love to save my heart? <br>
      <br>
      In the old testament, a fallen angel preaches: <br>
      Changing times, violence, fighting, and depravity. <br>
      All dreams will be ruined, toppled, and vanish <br>
      But I want to know: Is there sin in this world? <br>
      Use compassion to intertwine her soul with yours <br>
      And with you in it, the tired city sparks alive. <br>
      <br>
      My love, there are too many rumors. <br>
      How many lovers has history destroyed? <br>
      Then I will cry, and surprise her with a kiss <br>
      But I feel that I'm trapped. <br>
      <br>
      Amen, I've fallen back into sin, <br>
      The fallen angel asks the world <br>
      about the world's hope for salvation <br>
      and taking away the world's love <br>
      But all new doctrines have been abandoned. <br>
      <br>
      More regret, more fatigue, <br>
      another life with unfulfilled dreams, <br>
      I'm just another passerby on the street. <br>
      You with the halo and the wings on your back, <br>
      Will you use your love to save my heart? <br>
      <br>
      The Bible's fallen angel preaches again <br>
      But the world's depravity and lies don't change.  <br>
      None of the people Noah rescued remain, <br>
      Letting Eden turn to dust after the war. <br>
      Use love to wish for angels and souls, <br>
      And with you in it, the tired city sparks alive. <br>
      <br>
      Coldly, I watch the unending horizon <br>
      until nothing's left but the beautiful sunset glow. <br>
      I'm still fighting, I'm still resisting, <br>
      I still have a dream in my heart <br>
      But I still cannot pluck flowers from Eden. <br>
      <br>
      In the old testament, a fallen angel preaches: <br>
      Changing times, violence, fighting, and depravity. <br>
      All dreams will be ruined, toppled, and vanish <br>
      But I want to know: Is there sin in this world? <br>
      Use compassion to intertwine her soul with yours <br>
      And with you in it, the tired city sparks alive. <br>

It should be noted that I did this translation before I realized it was a fan cover... I don't regret anything, though. The lyrics are solid, and if nothing else, I learned a lot of vocab from this song.
