This is the first post on my new website. Currently, I'm 3/4 of the way through my mandatory Quarantine in Hong Kong. I've been telling myself to make a personal website for a while, so here it is! I built it with Jekyll and a LOT of inspriation from [Brittany Chiang's _gorgeous_ website](https://brittanychiang.com/). Perhaps one day I'll even get around to migrating it to Gatsby, which I think will make it easier for me to play around with things like JS animations and learning React-- but I'm just going to leave this here for now, and I'm pretty happy with it!
